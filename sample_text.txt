This file illustrates what reflowList can do to badly
formatted text. ReflowList finds the paragraph around the
cursor and reformats it. For this illustration, the wrap
column was set to 60.

   // This is in a C++/Java/Javascript/Typescript comment.
   // blah blah blah.
   //   An indented paragraph. ReflowList won't confuse
   //   paragraphs with different indentations.
   //
   //   It also supports lists:
   //   1.  Lists can be numeric, as shown here.
   //   2.  They can also be alphabetic, e.g., like this
   //       nested list:
   //      a) Parenthesis or periods may follow the list
   //         marker.
   //      B. This is an alphabetic list element.
   // To make this really useful, you should bind
   // reflowList.reflowParagraph to some key.

   # This is in a python/perl/whatever comment. It also
   # shows a different kind of list.
   # - reflowList handles bulleted lists. The second line of
   #   each list element is correctly indented and wrapped.
   # o The list marker may be '-' or 'o' or '*', followed by
   #   a space.
   # * You can customize this by changing the regular
   #   expresisons.

  """A python comment

  ReflowList also supports description lists, which are
  particularly handy for function argument documentation.

  Args:
    arg1: This is a special argument. Text can be wrapped;
      subsequent lines are indented extra spaces.
    arg2: This is another argument with some text that will
      wrap.
